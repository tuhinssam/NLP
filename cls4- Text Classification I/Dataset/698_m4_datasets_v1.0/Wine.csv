318,Vignobles Brumont,France,94,"The wine comes from the grand showpiece estate of Madiran. A blend that is dominated by Tannat produces a wine that is still so young. Bold fruits and firm tannins are right to the fore, along with acidity and a strong mineral texture. It's a powerful and impressive wine that also manages elegance as well. The wine will take several more years to soften. Drink from 2020.",Château Montus
319,Waters,US,94,"The aromas pop, with notes of orange peel, ember, cured meat, black olive and wet stone, with purple fruit lurking in the background.

320,Domaine de la Bégude,France,94,"This is a wine that is beginning to show some fine maturity. There are ripe fruits still very present, but they are matched by the secondary flavors, spice and warm tannins along with the classic herbal character of Mourvèdre. The wine is produced from organically grown grapes, giving purity as well as some serious structure in the background. Drink from 2018.",La Bégude
321,Bodega Classica,Spain,94,"Spicy yet sweet aromas of sarsaparilla root, saddle leather and earthy berry fruits precede a rich dense palate. This tastes of dark cherry and berry fruit, with an herbal shading adding complexity. Chocolaty oak takes hold on a solid long finish. Drink through 2024.",QP
322,Château Vignelaure,France,94,"This is one of the classics among Provence rosés. Produced from organically grown grapes and coming from an impressive red-wine producing estate east of Aix-en-Provence, the wine is structured and ageworthy with its blend that includes Cabernet Sauvignon. Rich and full of red fruits, the wine should be drunk from late 2017.",
323,Matarromera,Spain,94,"Ripe pure black-fruit aromas are touched up by notes of malty chocolate and mocha. This is proportionally big, with cheek-grabbing tannins, but it's not overly hard or unbalanced— just the opposite. Flavors of mocha, coffee, hazelnut and ripe berry fruits finish flush, dense and firm, with toasty notes and powerful but controlled residual tannins. Drink through 2030.",Prestigio Pago de las Solanas
324,Pellet Estate,US,94,"This single-vineyard estate wine is made by Nils Venge and Tom Rinaldi, who have somehow managed to capture quiet elegance and powerful fruit at the same time.

The wine is still just setting out and will not be ready to drink before 2019.",La Bégude
326,Pascual Toso,Argentina,94,"Open-grain oak aromas are out front, followed by sweeter scents of marzipan, prune and chocolate. A full, tannic palate is deep and dense, while toasty blackened flavors of cassis and blackberry finish with notes of mocha, chocolate and pepper. This is a bit rough and tannic, so cellaring will help it calm down. Drink through 2023.",Alta Barrancas Vineyards
327,Château d'Esclans,France,94,"This is a serious wine with a lighter brighter side. Its wood aging adds spice to the ripe red fruits and brings out the concentration and intensity. It is, in its way, an unexpected side of Provence rosé, emphasizing richness and complexity. But it all comes together: a fine wine that, after a year of aging, is ready to drink.",Garrus
328,Château Lagrézette,France,94,"From old vines in a tree-enclosed vineyard on the third terrace above the River Lot, this wine forms part of a range of wines featuring the soils and terraces of the Cahors vineyard. Named in homage to Marguerite de Massaut, a 16th-century owner of the estate, the wine is aged in new wood that gives it a minty character. That is balanced by the rich black-plum and truffle flavor and the intense acidity. The wine needs to age, so drink from 2021.",Cuvée Marguerite Massaut
329,Ponzi,US,94,"Polished in every way, this brings an enticing potpourri of almond paste, apple and white pepper. Wild yeast fermentation in oak (30% new) marries complex components in perfect precise balance.

330,Fratelli Alessandria,Italy,91,"Scents of woodland berry, rose petal, grilled herb, anisette and a balsamic note emerge on this firmly structured wine.

331,Friedrich-Wilhelm-Gymnasium,Germany,91,"Juicy, sun-kissed grapefruits and apple blossoms explode from this buoyantly fresh, off-dry Kabinett.

332,Galerie,US,91,"Dense, rich red fruit belies an elegant wine that finds balance despite the concentration of vanilla and berry. Soft, approachable and integrated tannin and oak let the whole exist as one, instead of separate parts. This shows off the appellation's mountain fruit and rocky minerality.",Latro
333,Granbazán,Spain,91,"Lightly leesy aromas of vanilla cookie are offset by crisp minerally apple and stone-fruit scents. This is pure and lifted by fine acidity, while flavors of apple, pineapple and lemon-lime end fresh, with a distant note of citrus pith. Drink immediately.",Etiqueta Ambar
334,Grieve,US,91,"From the Lovall Valley section of the Napa Valley quite near Sonoma, this lovely wine is awash in tropical mango, with lilts of pear and vanilla.

335,Herdade do Rocim,Portugal,91,"The top wine in the Rocim range is produced from selected Alicante Bouschet grapes.

Drink from 2019.",Grande Rocim Reserva
336,Jada Vineyard & Winery,US,91,"There's a cantaloupe-like ripeness on the nose of this blend of 37% Grenache Blanc, 33% Viognier and 30% Roussanne, but not overdone, layered with seared white peach, caramelized pear, poached apple and almond aromas. The palate is more restrained and quite grippy, with flavors of green-apple skins, Bosc pear and a touch of honey.",XCV
337,La Crema,US,91,"This lush offering opens with appealing aromas of rose petals and fresh strawberries, then glides into a smooth-as-silk midpalate.

338,Lawer,US,91,"A pretty salmon-pink in color, and a lovable quaffer, this wine is dry, crisp and brightly refreshing in succulent waves of grapefruit and tangerine, remarkably light in alcohol but not shy in flavor. Enjoy it on its own or with a range of foods—its lightness begets versatility.",Rosé of
339,Le Strette,Italy,91,"Aromas of slightly stewed fruit, steeped berry, spice and menthol unfold in the glass. The firm palate delivers juicy cherry, crushed raspberry, licorice, ground pepper and a mint note while bracing tannins and racy acidity provide the backbone.

Drink 2019–2031.",Brunate
343,Small Vines,US,91,"Aromas and flavors of sandalwood and grenadine layer around this velvety, seductive wine. It offers black tea, truffle and forest floor, the body sinewy and complex.

344,Terras de Alter,Portugal,91,"A classic northern Rhône valley blend of Syrah with a touch of Viognier, this massive wine is made from grapes grown on granite soil, which leaves its mark in dense minerality and great power. It is a wine for lovers of the big stuff, concentrated and needing to age. Drink from 2018.",Telhas
345,Terras de Alter,Portugal,91,"This is a rich, full-bodied wine that is ready to drink now. It still has a dry core of tannins, although they are overwhelmed by the rich, juicy black fruits and generous texture. It's a concentrated wine, high in alcohol, although that is really balanced by the fresh aftertaste.",Terra d'Alter
346,Testarossa,US,91,"Warm vanilla notes are laid across ripe nectarine, apple skin and a twist of lemon rind on this single-vineyard study by the Los Gatos-based winery.

348,Thörle,Germany,91,"Often herbal and a bit green in nature, Silvaner is a much maligned grape.

351,Winderlea,US,91,"A limited, popular entry in Winderlea's extensive single-vineyard lineup, this suggests cherry kirsch with streaks of coffee and tobacco.

362,Reustle,US,90,"Much like its companion from the Revelation & Sorek Bloc, this offers well-endowed flavors of melon and white peach, along with a touch of citrus.

369,Domaine Schoffit,France,90,"The slightest whiff of pepper on the nose leads to a spiced, leesy and slender palate on this unusual Alsace resident: it's Switzerland's Chasselas making an appearance.

1905,Fulcrum,US,87,"A very subtle aroma leads to a rich feel on the palate, where ripe plum and soft berry flavors emerge. This wine is totally smooth, warm and plush, full bodied but with soft tannins that make it easy to sip.",
1906,Kendall-Jackson,US,87,"Scents of lemon-cake icing meet the pretty yet not treacly tropical aromatics of white flowers on this barely off-dry wine. The sweetness is noticeable on the palate but far from overdone, with clean flavors of lemon custard, tangerine juice and a Key-lime finish.",Vintner's Reserve
1907,Manifesto!,US,87,"This smells oaky and tastes ripe and pure, like crushed blackberries and raspberries. It feels plush and smooth in the mouth, finishing on the soft side. While medium bodied, it has just a touch of tannin to balance the ripeness and make it appetizing to drink.",
1908,Marimar Estate,US,87,"Damp earth and forest floor mark this wine, a blend of various clones, the majority of which are Pommard. Red raspberry and cherry compete for attention aromatically and in taste, followed by a spiciness of Christmas clove.",La Masía Don Miguel Vineyard
1909,McManis,US,87,"This tastes honest, clean and direct, with a nice mixture of fruity, woody and savory herbal aromas and flavors. It's medium in body and offers just a touch of tannin to add a little grip to the texture. A tasty raspberry note gives it even more personality.",
1910,Murphy-Goode,US,87,"This warm-climate wine is fulsome and hearty in baked Asian pear and candied ginger. A dried-fruit quality stands out on the buxom palate, a buttery taste of dried apricot drizzled in honey and brioche.",Island Block
1911,Original House Wine,US,87,"This aromatic wine offers notes of jasmine, quinine, flowers and peach. It drinks medium sweet with lightly spritzy stone-fruit flavors.",
1912,Château la Chapelle Despagnet,France,87,"One of the many chateaus with vines on the wide valley floor of the Dordogne, this estate has made a lightly extracted wine that has chocolate as well as blackberry stalkiness. There's freshness as well, with fruit acidity that cuts through the mineral texture. Drink from 2018.",
1913,Château la Roque de By,France,87,"Fruity, soft and ripe, this is almost ready to drink. Attractive berry fruits are touched by a smoky character from the wood aging. Balancing Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot equally, the wine has ripe tannins and a gentle, juicy aftertaste. Drink from 2016.",
1914,Château Lacombe Noaillac,France,87,"This smoky wine has firm tannins and a tough core. The juicy fruit is taking its time to develop, although it will give the wine density and ripe berries in time. The vineyard, created in the early 1980s is now at peak maturity. Drink from 2017.",
1915,Château Lafleur-Gazin,France,87,"This wine is smooth and ripe, with soft tannins that are already so well integrated. The texture is dense, full of blackberry fruits, full in the mouth and with a velvet final texture. Drink from 2017.",
1916,Château le Reysse,France,87,"Fifty-year-old vines are the backbone to this firm wine. Mint and smoky wood-aging flavors give a dry, dense character. Underneath the Cabernet tannins and black currant fruit are developing well. This is a wine for the medium-term, drink from 2017.",
1917,Chateau Ste. Michelle,US,87,"Coming from the warm 2013 vintage, this easy-drinking wine offers notes of sweet corn, pear and peach with light barrel accents. The fruit flavors are elegant with a lightly creamy feel.",
1918,Caccia al Piano 1868,Italy,87,"Chocolate, coconut, plum and coffee aromas lead the nose on this densely concentrated wine. The monolithic palate offers black cherry, chocolate-covered coconut and oak alongside astringent tannins that dry out the mouth.",Ruit Hora
1919,CULT,US,87,"Milk chocolate and pomegranate curiously mix in this mid-weight, lowly oaked nonvintage Cabernet, blended with 18% Merlot and 2% Petite Sirah. New American oak aged most of it, with a bit of French, too, only 25% of the whole new.",
1920,Anam Cara,US,90,"This is the first release from a new, two-acre vineyard devoted to this old-school clone. It's what might be called sculpted, with excellent definition among all the components. Pomegranate and raspberry fruit carry a hint of pine needle, and the finish carries  through with good focus and medium length.",Nicholas Vineyard Wädenswil Clone
1921,Weingut Liebfrauenstift,Germany,90,"Ripe, heady tropical fruit and citrus aromas extend onto the palate of this dry, yet deeply fruity, concentrated Riesling. It's unabashedly juicy, but textured and mineral on the palate, finishing long and with a streak of high-toned acidity.",Dry
1922,Donkey & Goat,US,90,"Crisp in green apple and lemon, this light Chardonnay, only 12.4% in alcohol, will sweep you off your feet with Thai food, seafood or as a before-dinner quaff. From an un-grafted, old Wente clone vineyard found abandoned (thus the name), it has a trace of salinity throughout and a lurking layer of Asian spice.",Untended
1923,Elena Walch,Italy,90,"Intense aromas include crushed tomato vine, elderflowers, hay and tropical fruit. The vibrant palate offers yellow peach, kiwi, honeydew melon and a hint of lemon pastry alongside crisp acidity.",Castel Ringberg
1924,Erste Neue,Italy,90,"This savory wine opens with a heady fragrance of rose and lychee. The linear, steely palate offers rich tropical fruit and a saline note brightened by energizing mineral sensations. It has nice length and finishes dry. Oliver McCrum, T. Edward Wines.",
1925,Erste Neue,Italy,90,"Aromas of exotic fruit, green melon and crushed tomato vine carry over to the palate along with a mineral note. The vibrant acidity gives a linear character and a clean, focused finish. Oliver McCrum, T. Edward Wines.",Stern
1926,Juslyn Vineyards,US,90,"Some ageable Cabs are lovely to drink on release. Not this one. It's tough in tannins, with a gum-stinging astringency. Below all that are ripe, concentrated blackberry jam and cassis flavors. Blended with Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, it's already throwing some sediment, a good sign, which means you won't have to wait 20 years for it to come around. Pop that cork after 2018.",
1927,Kellerei Kaltern Caldaro,Italy,90,"This structured Pinot Grigio boasts aromas of yellow spring flowers, exotic fruit, citrus and a hint of Alpine herbs. The juicy, vibrant palate delivers green apple, pear, white peach and citrus allied with fresh acidity.",Söll
1928,Kendall-Jackson,US,90,"This Merlot is dry, full-bodied and delicious in fruit and oak. Black cherries, currants, mocha, plums, vanilla and fragrant sandalwood all come together to provide a complex drink that's firm in tannins and fancy in the finish. Drink now.",Grand Reserve
1929,Kings Mountain,US,90,"There's something old-fashioned about this blend of all five classic Bordeaux varieties. Partly it's the tannins, which are brusque, and partly it's the alcohol, which is low. On the other hand, the fruit is ripe in the modern style, brimming with raspberries and cherries, and there's plenty of fancy new French oak. It's a pretty wine to drink now through 2020.",
1930,Grafen Neipperg,Germany,90,"Hints of menthol and bramble meld with rich black-plum and cherry notes in this composed Pinot Noir. It's juicy and concentrated in black fruit flavors, but graced with a spray of delicate floral notes and brisk, revitalizing acidity. Soft, fine tannins square off the finish.",Trocken
1931,Leonard Kreusch,Germany,90,"Musky floral, spice and cherry-blossom notes meld in the exuberant bouquet of this aromatic auslese. It's blossomy on the palate as well, and luscious, with sweet peach and yellow cherry flavors. It's unabashedly lavish, but balanced by a streak of citrus acidity and a long, lingering finish.",Piesporter Goldtröpfchen Auslese
1932,Leonard Kreusch,Germany,90,"Ebullient on the nose, with scents of mango, lemongrass and yellow flowers, this off-dry Riesling is intensely tropical in style, but elegant as well, with searing lime acidity that cuts through layers of juicy, ripe fruit and finishes remarkably dry.",Piesporter Goldtröpfchen Kabinett
1933,San Pedro,Chile,90,"This wine shows ripeness, depth and purity. In the mouth, it is saturated and thick. Flavors of saffron, tomato paste, oregano and stewed berry fruits are pure Kankana. A different breed of Syrah, it reflects San Pedro's pioneering efforts in the Elqui Valley.",Kankana del Elqui Solar No. 10
1934,Prinz Salm,Germany,90,"Whiffs of freshly pressed apples are accented by pretty peach and honeysuckle notes on this dry, refreshing Riesling. The palate is lean in style, with subtle stone-fruit flavors that feel brisk and vivacious against a backdrop of pineapple acidity.",Trocken
1935,Dr. Pauly Bergweiler,Germany,90,"There's a savory vein of herbs and smoke that persists from start to finish on this deeply fruity auslese, adding a shade of dimension and complexity. It's zippy in lemony acidity, but silky and sweet, with luscious flavors of preserved peach and tangerine.",Bernkasteler Badstube Auslese
1936,Black Kite,US,90,"This powerful Pinot, from one of the three distinct blocks within Black Kite's estate vineyard, offers earthy plum compote and blueberry with a lingering background note of vanilla. Bright, grippy and layered, the finish offers toasty oak.",Stony Terrace
1937,CàMaiol,Italy,90,"Structured and elegant, it delivers aromas of white flowers, stone fruit and almonds. The juicy fruit palate recalls yellow peach, apricot and pineapple while aromatic herbs and white almond add depth.",Molino
1938,Château Anthonic,France,90,"A rich, perfumed and juicy wine, it is full of fruit and also solidly structured. Coming into balance, it still needs some more time. Give this full-bodied, dense wine until 2017.",
1939,Château de Cénac,France,90,"A dark and brooding wine, it's very much a Malbec that needs to age. Solid tannins, berry fruits and concentrated structure all promise a serious wine that needs time to mature. Drink from 2017.",Cuvée Prestige
1940,Château de Pierreux,France,90,"This impressive wood-aged wine has weight, rich black and red berry flavors and a smooth, unctuous texture. With its concentration, ripeness, acidity and tannins, it could age through 2016.",La Réserve du Château
1941,Coup de Foudre,US,90,"Given the difficulties of the 2010 vintage, this wine is a success. The tannins are young, thick and astringent, and then the acids kick in. After that initial assault, the palate begins to get more interesting complexities of black currants, blueberries, minerals and oak. The suggestion is ageability, but only limited. Give it until 2016–2017 years and drink with hearty fare.",
1942,Dão Sul,Portugal,90,"Dense and structured, this is a firm wine from the Santar estate. It is powered by its tannins and partnered with ripe black plum fruits. There is a feeling of tough rocks, a dry core that need some time. Drink from 2015.",Casa de Santar
1943,Dão Sul,Portugal,90,"This complex, ripe wine reflects the steely character of Dão whites along with perfumed acidity and rich white fruit flavors. Lime, apples and pears are smoothed by wood aging and given a final burst of freshness. It's ready to drink.",Casa de Santar Reserva Branco
1944,Viu Manent,Chile,90,"Gritty aromas of berry fruits, wild herbs and leather are hardly shy. This has a lot of energy and acidity across the palate, while flavors of blackberry, plum and coffee finish ripe, baked and rich, with a slight raisiny note. Enjoy with grilled beef or lamb.",El Olivar Alto Single Vineyard
1945,Abbazia di Novacella,Italy,90,"Here's a Pinot Grigio for grownups. It opens with aromas of white flowers, Granny Smith apple and a hint of flint. The palate delivers creamy peach, apple and melon alongside a touch of vanilla. It conveys wonderful depth and freshness.",
1946,Angel Vine,US,90,"A small planting of an unusual “Upright” clone yields this fragrant, smoky, lightly earthy Pinot Noir. Chock full of briary red fruits, it's a tart, lip-smacking wine, drinking well in its youth, but also positioned (via bracing acidity) for further years of bottle age. The young fruit gives a pretty, cherry candy note to the finish.",The Morgster
1947,Bardessono,US,90,"This is a tannic, acidic, hard-to-appreciate wine due to the cold conditions of the 2011 vintage. But the wine, which is 100% Cabernet and was aged in 50% new French oak, still is a great success, testimony to skillful viticultural and winemaking practices. With a solid core of black currants, it wants until 2020 in the cellar.",Maxine's Vineyard
1948,Vie di Romans,Italy,90,"Full bodied, this opens with aromas of vanilla, butterscotch, citrus and oak. The palate offers ripe golden apple, pear and lemon pastry, all layered with well-integrated oak. The rich flavors are balanced by fresh acidity.",
1949,Morandé,Chile,90,"Despite showing raspy rawness on the nose, this Cab Franc is also aromatic with earth, spice, leather and leafy black fruits. The palate is tannic and slightly reduced, while flavors of baked berry, licorice, hard spices and chocolate finish herbal, peppery and gritty in feel due to residual tannic grab. Drink through 2017.",Edición Limitada
1950,El Xamfrà,Spain,88,"Dusty aromas of yellow apple and cream soda are creamier than the palate, which is tangy, lemony and green. This tastes of briny citrus and green apple, while tangerine, lime and green-herb flavors define the finish.",Brut
1951,Aljibes,Spain,88,"Plum and berry aromas are lively and come with a mild scent of animal fur. This blend of four grapes, led by Tempranillo, feels blocky and loosely defined, while flavors of plum, raspberry and a touch of herbal green finish spicy and woody. Will function best as an everyday wine.",Viña Aljibes Cabernet  Sauvignon-Syrah-Cabernet Franc-Tempranillo
1952,Paul Cheneau,Spain,88,"Cidery aromas vie with bready notes to give the bouquet complexity. This feels zesty, juicy and citric, with a lean, racy body. Apple cider, green herb, lime and scallion flavors finish with a lasting taste of lime.",Blanc de Blancs Brut Reserva
1953,Altesino,Italy,88,"Aromas of blue flowers, forest floor and red berry lead the nose on this straightforward red. A blend of 80% Sangiovese, with 20% Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, the smooth, accessible palate offers red cherries, strawberries and anise alongside bright acidity.",
1954,Anam Cara,US,88,"This unoaked, Dijon-clone wine is lively and lush, with tongue-coating fruit. Melon, banana and papaya flavors steer it in a tropical direction, with a lick of mineral and phenolic bite giving further support.",Nicholas Estate
1955,Bodegas Berceo,Spain,88,"Stripped-back cherry and raspberry flavors take on a jammy character with airing. This is tight, bright and mildly acidic on the palate, with raspberry, red plum and brown sugar flavors. Toast and a molasses-like sweetness carry an otherwise juicy finish.",Viña Berceo Crianza
1956,Bruliam,US,88,"Soft and earthy, this wine's herbal, funky nature suggests Carneros as much as Sonoma Coast, with black tea and crunchy dried cranberry lurking on the back of the palate. Medium in weight, it eases into a mellow finish.",Sangiacomo Vineyard
1957,Carlton Cellars,US,88,"Here is a well-focused wine with appealing toastiness as soon as it's opened. Fruit flavors are still tight, but unfold into tangy raspberry. It spent 18 months in half new French oak, to good effect.",Roads End Estate Vineyard
1958,Compañia de Vinos del Atlántico,Spain,88,"Blackberry, cherry and earthy aromas are backed by a secondary wave of oaky char. This is 80% Garnacha and 20% Carignan with raw clamp to the palate created by grabby tannins and tomatoey acidity. Briny raspberry and plum flavors finish with rubbery tannins and related grab. This is a tough wine but one with lots of life and power. Drink through 2019.",Pinyolet Selección
1959,Cornerstone,US,88,"Closed on the nose at first, this wine reventualy reveals black currant and cassis around wrapped tobacco leaf, the midpalate somewhat dry and puckering in tannin. Concentrated and dense, it finishes in dusty mocha.",Black Label Stepping Stone
1960,Delaforce,Portugal,88,"This is a bold, ripe wine that is full of black fruits and generous tannins. It has a rich, warm character that is tempered by acidity and a crisp black currant aftertaste. Drink now.",
1961,Domaine du Vistre,France,88,"This wine starts off a bit tarry or rubbery, but with airing that dissipates to reveal a dry, savory, complex rosé. It's a blend of Syrah, Grenache and Mourvèdre that builds in layers of texture from chalky to silky on the finish.",Cuvée Gladiateur
1962,Eola Hills,US,88,"Chunky and fleshy, this is loaded with spicy pear and lighter melon and tangerine fruits. Full, forward and fresh, it's delicious and ready to go.",
1963,Herdade de São Miguel,Portugal,88,"This is a satisfying, ripe and rich wine. It has big layers of red fruits, attractive spice from partial wood aging and fresh acidity. Still young, it will be even better from early 2016.",Ciconia Tinto
1964,Jarvis,US,88,"Made from a majority of Cabernet Franc, complemented with a small handful of Merlot, the wine is aged in new French oak half barrels. Tannic and savory in cassis and cranberry, the wine also shows a trace of black tea and tomato leaf. The wine's oak remains extremely pronounced, which suggests some time in cellar, through 2020.",Will Jarvis' Science Project
1965,Le Roc,France,88,"Pure Négrette produces a smooth, black cherry and red berry-flavored wine. Light hints of wood from aging in big barrels have helped to give the wine a rich and spicy character. This is further enhanced by black-fruit acidity that adds a fresh streak to this warm, ripe wine. Drink now.",La Folle Noire d'Ambat
1966,Licia,Spain,88,"Apple, peach and melon aromas are fresh and easy to like. This has a pure palate, with citric and malic acidity offset by pulpy weight. Peach and apricot flavors finish long, and overall this should maintain its good shape over the next year.",
1967,Matetic,Chile,88,"Rubbery, somewhat funky aromas shift toward iodine and stewed blackberry. A dense palate houses rubbery tannins that are short on structure. Baked blackberry, plum and cassis flavors finish toasty, herbal, leathery and salty.",Corralillo
1968,Olivi,Italy,88,"A hearty blend of Merlot and Cabernet, this opens with aromas of cedar, vanilla, underbrush and black currant. The warm, one-dimensional palate delivers dried black cherries, raisins, tobacco and anisette alongside velvety tannins. You'll also get the heat of alcohol that dominates the finish.",Tempore
1969,Pietro Beconcini,Italy,88,"Made entirely from Tempranillo—a rarity in Italy—this opens with aromas of blue flowers, plum and a whiff of leather. The smooth palate delivers dried cherry and prune, accented by ground pepper and oak-driven spices. Bracing but fine-grained tannins and fresh acidity provide support. Drink through 2018.",IXE
1970,Poggio al Tesoro,Italy,88,"Green bell pepper and cedar aromas lead the nose of this easy-drinking blend of Syrah, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. The aromas carry over to the fresh palate, along with black currants and black cherries. Supple tannins support the juicy flavors.",Mediterra
1971,Porca de Murça,Portugal,88,"This ripe, tannic wine has a good sense of balance between the firm structure and the potential of the rich, full-blown fruit. Blackberry fruit shows strongly, giving a dense wine that will still develop quickly. Drink from 2016.",Tinto
1972,Rutherford Grove,US,88,"Mocha toffee and raspberry liqueur provide an alluring entry into this wine, before it evolves into soft layers of blackberry and black currant. Medium to full-bodied, this has thick, dry tannins that stay prominent through the finish.",Pestoni Family Estate Reserve
1973,San Felice,Italy,88,"Made from the native grape Pugnitello, this hearty red opens with aromas of dried Mediterranean herbs, scorched earth, allspice and overripe black fruit. The warm, forward palate doles out baked plum, ripe blackberries, blue flowers, clove and the heat of evident alcohol. Velvety tannins wrap around the palate, but the dominant alcohol throws it off balance and gives it a monolithic character.",
1974,Siltstone,US,88,"Showing a slightly coppery blush hue, this softly aromatic wine has a pleasing muskiness. It's high acid, slightly spritzy, clean and fresh. Though perfectly quaffable, it's not a typical Oregon Pinot Gris.",Blacktail Vineyard
1975,Vidon Vineyard,US,88,"Fruity and forward, with a spritzy mouthfeel, this is like a bowl of cherries, with a cherry candy finish. Highlights of orange and grapefruit come through also. Drink now through 2016.",3 Clones
1976,Walnut City WineWorks,US,88,"The vineyard was planted in the early 1970s, and this wine shows some old-vine complexity. It's an elegant drink, with a nicely finessed fruit and acid balance. Light and clean flavors suggest watermelon and raspberry with a hint of cherry.",Wirtz Vineyard Reserve
1977,Walnut City WineWorks,US,88,"This is not as light on the palate as the low alcohol reading might suggest. The raspberry and strawberry fruit carries aromas and flavors of composted earth. It's an interesting wine, and offers good value in a Willamette Valley Pinot.",
1978,Kühling-Gillot,Germany,88,"Scheurebe, a Riesling hybrid common in Germany and Austria, is a rare find stateside, particularly in dry styles. Zesty lime pith and pineapple flavors are brisk and revitalizing in this light-bodied sip. A touch of fresh herbs and white-tea astringency lend nuance to the crisp finish.",Qvinterra Trocken
1979,Domaine d'Arton,France,88,"With vines in the northeast of the Gers region, this winery produces impressively ripe red wines. This wood-aged and spicy wine is still young and needs time to integrate the wood with the red berry fruits. It does have weight and potential richness, so give it until 2016.",La Croix d'Arton
1980,Firestone,US,88,"Earthy aromas of dried herbs, forest floor and freshly felled fennel shrubs emerge form this blend from the now William Foley-owned Firestone brand. Warm cherries and tart acidity make for a nice blend of fruit and complexity on the palate.",
1981,Gitton Père et Fils,France,88,"A soft and rounded wine, it's ripe, full in the mouth and warm in character. A steely edge merges with the ripe apple and pear flavors to give a wine that's rich and ready to drink.",Les Montachins
1982,Henri Bourgeois,France,88,"Very dry, with a firm mineral content, this rosé really needs food. Fresh red currant and raspberry fruitiness are surrounded by tannins and tight acidity. Drink by 2015.",Les Baronnes
1983,Herdade de São Miguel,Portugal,88,"Ripe and smooth, this is a rich, rounded wine that has a warm character, tasting of sunshine. With soft tannins, a touch of caramel from the wood aging and layers of black fruits, it's an attractive wine to drink now, or age until 2017.",Ciconia Tinto
1984,Kaiken,Argentina,88,"Jammy cassis, blackberry and foxy aromas define the nose on this lush, almost ponderous blend of Malbec, Bonarda and Petit Verdot. There's flatness to the palate along with flavors of blackbery, plum and dark, minty oak. A heavy, grabby finish is bold and voluminous.",Terroir Series Corte Malbec-Bonarda-Petit Verdot
1985,Marchesi di Barolo,Italy,88,"This is rather subdued but after ample time in the glass it reveals aromas of oak, toast, espresso and chocolate that continue on to the palate along with vanilla notes. It lacks the vintage's hallmark intensity. Drying tannins give an astringent finish.",Coste di Rose
1986,Mario Marengo,Italy,88,"Pretty aromas include violet, crushed berries and a balsamic note. But the palate isn't very expressive, offering up raw Morello cherry and espresso notes alongside racy acidity and astringent tannins. Drink after 2020.",Bricco delle Viole
1987,Peter Paul Wines,US,88,"Old Wente clones drive the richness of this wine, a mix of lemon, oak and fennel, with a touch of spice on the finish.

Bacigalupi has a history of famous Chardonnay, having provided grapes for Chateau Montelena's winning Chardonnay in the 1976 Paris Tasting.",Bacigalupi Vineyard
1988,Proemio,Argentina,88,"There's a mix of herbal aromas and raisin on this blend of Malbec, Merlot, Cab Sauvignon and Syrah. In the mouth, it's edgy and rubbery, with rock-hard tannins. Flavors of baked black fruits, tobacco and citrus peel finish raw and rubbery. This will need a lot of air and also hearty  food to show its better side.",Grand Reserve Winemaker's Selection
1989,Roco,US,88,"A penetrating whiff of wintergreen is the first impression of this aromatic young wine. The tightly-wound fruit brings cranberry and tart plum flavors into focus, followed by a lick of dark chocolate running through stiff tannins.",
1990,Saget la Perrière,France,88,"This is a firmly wood-aged wine, full of spice and burnt toast flavors. They leave little room for the berry fruits at the moment. It is structured, a statement wine with its heavy bottle, and needing time to round out. Drink from 2016.",Marie de Beauregard
1991,Saintsbury,US,88,"This is a rich, broad-shouldered Pinot Noir, woodsy and oaky with a firm and fierce grip on the palate. It leans more toward earth and smoke than exuberant fruit. Textured in soft undertones of silk, it also offers plenty of fresh herb, a component to take advantage of in pairing.",Brown Ranch
1992,Siduri,US,88,"A delicate, almost fragile wine, this opens with tart fruit flavors of strawberry and red plum. There's more than enough acidity, smooth tannins, and a graceful flow to the wine, ending with a light dusting of cocoa.",Arbre Vert Vineyard
1993,Sogevinus,Portugal,88,"This is a rich and jammy wine, packed with black fruits as well as dark tannins. Dark chocolate flavors come from the wood aging which also leaves a burnt taste. These both suggest this potentially fine wine needs to age. Drink from 2016.",Veedha
1994,Torii Mor,US,88,"Even with some hours of breathing time, this remains tight and tannic, with compact flavors of black cherry hard candy. A streak of cola is highlighted with brown spices. The wine loses momentum in the finish, which thins out and quickly fades.",La Colina Vineyard
1995,Walt,US,88,"Loaded with scents and flavors of chocolate, mocha and buttered toast, this forward and very pretty wine surrounds a light core of strawberry and cherry fruit. It's polished—even silky—and very tasty, though without the depth and complexity for long-term aging.",Shea Vineyard
1996,Bodegas Ontañón,Spain,88,"Aromas of stone fruits and citrus are dusty and nice; so is the mouthfeel, which is fresh but shows texture and body. Watermelon, nectarine and citrus flavors finish slightly bitter but within reason.",Vetiver Tempranillo
1997,Bodegas Vínícola Real,Spain,88,"Despite being nine years old, this comes across young and jammy, with foxy aromas of wild berries and animal fur. The palate is blocky, heavily extracted and fully ripe in feel. Flavors of prune and blackberry finish with hard tannins. Drink or hold.",200 Monges Selección Especial Reserva
1998,Camparo,Italy,88,"This Barolo has a somewhat raw quality, delivering sensations of tart red cherry, black pepper, sage, coffee bean and bitter chocolate. The bracing tannins are astringent and overpowering at this stage. Try it after 2020.",Boiolo
1999,Carr,US,88,"Stewed tomato, graphite and mushrooms in a brown sauce lead the aromas on this single-vineyard offering from downtown Santa Barbara-based winemaker Ryan Carr. The tomatoes continue on the palate, alongside cran-raisin juice.",Turner Vineyard
2000,Cascina Chicco,Italy,88,"This wine has an unusual combination of sweet and sour sensations that include ripe plum, sour cherry, vanilla, dark chocolate, hay, dill, sage and leather. It's still very young with nervous acidity and aggressive tannins that need time to tame.",Rocche di Castelletto
